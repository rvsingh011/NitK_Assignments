<p>ASSIGNMENT 1 (22 August 2017)
Observe the HTTP traffic, headers and performance when browsing different types of websites (e.g. normal text, mixed content, video buffering.. ) using various HTTP traffic analyser tools.
Set up your own Web server on your lab computer and host a simple website (with multiple pages of varied content, e.g. text, html, images, audio and video, scripts). Now, observe the HTTP traffic from your computer using the tools and identify the various HTTP primitives like request/response, methods, headers etc.)
Set up a https:// connection for your website (sites offering free digital certificates are available on the Web) and experiment to evaluate if the http:// version or https:// version loads faster for pages with varied content.  Also check if different versions of HTTP itself perform better when compared to HTTPS.
Submit a detailed report of your work by email by 11.59PM on Sunday,  27th of August 2017 (and also upload to Course Moodle on IRIS)
